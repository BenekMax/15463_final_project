# 15463_final_project

This repository includes the code for the 15-463 S22 final project.
The attempted implementation is based on the algorithm described by
the paper https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/PAMI16/shading_TPAMI.pdf and is based on the existing code in the repository at https://github.com/wangruihuan/Light-Field-Depth-Estimation-Code.

Additionally, the Plenopticam repo was used to extract the light-field images from raw Lytro .lfr files, which can be found here: https://github.com/hahnec/plenopticam.
